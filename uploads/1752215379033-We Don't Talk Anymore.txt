Lyrics of Song "Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez - We Don't Talk Anymore" 

Припев [Charlie Puth]:
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do...

[Charlie Puth]:
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily

[Charlie Puth]:
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Припев [Charlie Puth]:
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Selena Gomez]:
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong


[Selena Gomez]:
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Припев [Charlie Puth + Selena Gomez]:
That we don't talk anymore
(We don't we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(We don't we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
(We don't we don't)
What was all of it for?
(We don't we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
Like we used to do

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]:
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

Припев [Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]:
That we don't talk anymore
(We don't we don't)
We don't talk anymore
(We don't we don't)
We don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't love anymore
(We don't we don't)
What was all of it for?
(We don't we don't)
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]:
(We don't talk anymore)
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight (Oh)
If he's holding onto you so tight (Oh)
The way I did before
(We don't talk anymore)
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game (Oh)
Now I can't get you out of my brain (Woah)
Oh, it's such a shame

[Charlie Puth & Selena Gomez]:
That we don't talk anymore
